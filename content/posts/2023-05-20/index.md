My son attends a school that was built in 1950. When I first learned that from [the school's website](https://abingdon.apsva.us/about-us/our-school/), I figured the school must have been segregated. We live in the South, and 1950 was before Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954. It didn't feel great that my son was attending a school that used to be segregated. I tried not to think about it.

Later on, in February last year, my son came home from Kindergarten saying he'd learned about Rosa Parks having to sit on the back of the bus because she was Black. I found it odd that his teacher would use the Montgomery Bus Boycott as the starting-off point for teaching kindergarteners about segregation. After all, this was a school that had been segregated. But, I figured Rosa Parks was part of the state curriculum, which was likely taught at all schools regardless of their individual history.

Still, I suspected many teachers and students didn't know that the school had been segregated. I also suspected that showing students black and white photos of civil rights events in Alabama was teaching students here that segregation is something that happened a long time ago, far away. I thought that we could do better.

I hoped that if I learned more about the school's history, including its history of segregation, I could share that with current students to help make that era's injustices more relevant to them. I also hoped that if I could find the first Black student to enroll at the school, I could show students that desegregation was in the recent past, not ancient history. So, I decided to do a little digging.

My research started with the [Virginia Chronicle](https://virginiachronicle.com/), a searchable newspaper archive offered by the Library of Virginia. [I had remembered it from a recent local news article.](https://www.arlnow.com/2021/06/25/new-digital-archives-provide-glimpse-into-local-history/) There are a few Arlington newspapers that are accessible in the Chronicle: the Sun (1935-1951), the Daily Sun (1951-1956) and the Northern Virginia Sun (1957-1978). Searching for the school's name in these Arlington newspapers brought up a wealth of information about the history of the school. This included photos from [the school's groundbreaking](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/images/1949-11-04.jpg) and of [the first principal](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/images/1950-06-23.jpg), and [an early classroom photo](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/images/1950-11-03.jpg) in a room that bore a striking resemblence to my son's kindergarten classroom. Though there are some key gaps in the mid-1950's, and nothing currently in the Chronicle for Arlington after 1978, the [archives of the Washington Post](https://library.arlingtonva.libguides.com/aboutwashingtonpost) and the [Washington Star](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/issues/) helped fill in some of these gaps.

Admittedly, these articles didn't directly answer my original questions about the school's desegregation. I never found an article describing the circumstances of the school's integration. However, during this time I learned about another library resource: the [Center for Local History](https://library.arlingtonva.us/center-for-local-history/), which is an office within Arlington library that organizes and maintains content related to Arlington history. I made an appointment with them, and requested to review material related to the school's history, with a focus on desegregation.

On that first visit in April 2022, I found [a document from 1965](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/images/1965-06-09.png) stating that there were no Black students at the school at that time. The librarian working that day also referred me to a library website that contains additional scanned documents related to the desegregation of the county's schools; [there I found a document stating that there were three Black students at the school in 1969](https://projectdaps.org/items/show/1421). So I had a range of time during which I was fairly certain the school was integrated: 1965-1969.

The immediate question I had was: what took so long? The first school in Arlington — Stratford Junior High — had integrated in 1959. Why were so many Arlington schools still segregated so many years later? I went back to the Virginia Chronicle to search my neighborhood's history for any clues. One event jumped out at me: [a 1966 protest about housing discrimination](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/images/1966-04-03.png). Black applicants argued that they weren't given a fair chance at securing a lease in my neighborhood, which was a rental property at that time. It occurred to me that it was probably the same at other rental properties nearby, and that the school's entire attendance area was made up of rental properties that discriminated against Black applicants. That's what likely kept the school segregated after *de jure* segregation had ended.

Several months later, I realized there were many more files at the Center for Local History related to school desegregation after looking through [a "finding aid" on an obscure library website](https://libraryarchives.arlingtonva.us/Detail/objects/13). This helped me figure out what was available in the library's archives so I could request specific, relevant files. I did so on three more visits starting in December 2022.

I found the most important document on a visit in January.

{{< image src="images/1969-05-13.png" alt="A document showing when each school in Arlington integrated" >}}

I gave a sort of involuntary yelp when I found this. It's a single, standalone document that shows when each school in Arlington integrated. I found it in a vaguely-named file in a record group concerning desegregation (Record Group 69, Series 3, Box 8, File 10, which is called "History Documents"). I have not seen it anywhere online despite its obvious historical value. It shows that my kids' school — conveniently listed first on the page — admitted its first Black student in 1968, and that three Black students were enrolled in that first year. That timing made perfect sense since the [Fair Housing Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1968#Title_VIII%E2%80%94fair_housing) passed in 1968, which aimed to prevent the sort of blatant discrimination that had likely kept the school segregated for so long.

So I now knew what year integration had happened. But I still knew nothing about the circumstances of the integration. And there weren't any comprehensive enrollment records left from that era, or any other document that would even come close to providing the names of those three students.

I started showing long-time teachers at the school what I had been able to find out and asking them what they knew. Word got back to the school librarian, who told me that I was welcome to look through a box of old documents she had that had been sealed up for at least several years. I didn't expect much. However, it turned out that it was mostly filled with yearbooks, and I was surprised to see they went back to the 1960's. There was even one from 1968. Here are a couple of pages from it:

{{< image src="images/yearbook-1968-1969-6-cropped.png" alt="Yearbook photos from 1968-1969" >}}
{{< image src="images/yearbook-1968-1969-1-cropped.png" alt="Yearbook photos from 1968-1969" >}}

Seeing these yearbook photos was remarkable. I was more curious than ever to know the story behind the school's integration. Unfortunately, the yearbook had no names. But the photos brought me closer than ever. I showed them to school staff and people in the community to see if anyone could give me any leads. Eventually, a community member directed me to a Facebook group for people who grew up in my neighborhood. The group had already shared some valuable photos I'd never seen before, including [a photo of what the school looked like when it was built in 1950](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/images/fb_1955-1957school3.jpg). I shared the yearbook photos with the group and asked if anybody could identify either of the Black girls in the photos. Two people quickly responded with the name of the girl in 6th grade.

Her name was unique enough that it was not difficult to find her contact information. I was able to get in touch with her and we had a brief conversation. Unfortunately, she did not wish to share her story. She did say that her experience at the school was not positive. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to learn more, but I was satisfied that I had done all that I could.

At this point, I wanted to share with students what I'd learned. I made a presentation to the school's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, and they recommended that I present to fourth grade students, as that is the year that students learn about Virginia history, including desegregation. I reached out to the school's fourth grade teachers, and all five of them generously gave me forty minutes to speak to each of their classes to talk about the school's history, including what I was able to learn about its desegregation.

I showed several old photos from the school and the neighborhood that I had found in newspapers, in the Center for Local History's archives, and on Facebook. I showed them the floor plan of the original school, which was relevant since most of the fourth grade classrooms in which I was presenting happened to be original classrooms. We talked about how the school building had seen renovations and additions, but that some of it was still relatively unchanged. I showed them photos from a 1985 playground construction project, which they really enjoyed.

And I explained that the school had been segregated. This seemed to surprise some students. I walked them through the history, starting with Brown v. Board of Education, local civil disobedience to [Massive Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_resistance), and protests of housing discrimination in our neighborhood. When I showed them the 1968 yearbook photos, there was an awed silence as they soaked it in. I explained that integration didn't just happen at Stratford or Little Rock; at every school in the South that was old enough, *someone was first*. And that includes their own school. I concluded by saying that history wasn't just for states and countries, but that a neighborhood or even a building like a school could have its own history. And sometimes this type of history is the most interesting.

Overall, I think the students got a lot out of it. I've had a couple of them come up to me in the neighborhood since then and tell me that they enjoyed my presentation, which warms my heart.

While I was doing all of this research, I produced [a website where I obsessively documented everything I found about the school's history](https://www.abingdonpta.org/history/). I shared it with the students at the end of my presentation. I hope it continues to serve as a resource for curious students and other members of the community.

I'll soon have more opportunities to share stories about local history, as I'm joining my neighborhood's historical society. I'm looking forward to learning more, and to sharing what I learn with my neighbors.
