There was a time when the internet wasn't so scary. A cherished part of my after-school ritual as a teenager was to write a blog entry and read my friends' entries. We wrote in long-form about our lives, using unguarded language to describe our emotions. It's almost unthinkable now, but at the time we thought it would never end. This was the internet to us: we each had our own webpage which described our lives. Our Xangas, Blogspots, Livejournals reflected our experiences and personalities.

I remember several incidents that caused this vision of the internet to lose its luster for me. During my senior year of high school, I observed on StatCounter that someone had arrived at my blog as a result of searching for my English teacher's obscure surname. (I had naïvely used my blog to complain about him a great deal.) I assumed the teacher himself had viewed my blog and I panicked; I revised all entries to only include the first initials of my teachers' names, and I used robots.txt to ban all search engines from crawling my blog. (I never learned if it was him.)

A few months later, I received a phone call at my home from the College Board threatening me that if I didn't edit one of my blog entries, they would withhold one of my Advanced Placement test results. I had recently taken the AP Exam for U.S. Government and Politics, and I'd mentioned on my blog that there was a question on the Federalist Papers for which my class had not prepared me. I suppose they considered this comment to be a spoiler. However, this was weeks after the exam and no one was still taking it — I believe they were just flexing their muscles because they could. I took it down and I still received an "incomplete" test result soon afterwards, although this was later revised to grant me full credit. Looking at StatCounter afterwards, the College Board had used some sort of proprietary web crawling engine that had ignored my robots.txt crawling policy. Lesson learned — again — that everything on the internet is public.

Finally, in college someone left a not-so-nice comment about me on one of my entries. It was vague, but irritating, as I'd always enjoyed reading the comments on my blog and this sullied that ritual. As small as that comment was, it discouraged me from writing as much. Notably, blogs had fallen somewhat out of favor at this point; the long-form, earnest writing of our high school years seemed passé in light of the pithier Facebook posts and photos that most of my peers used to document their college experiences. Blogging had become lonelier.

I continued to use my blog to write about my travels. I felt that my travel-related entries were more interesting, and more important to record too. When my travels became less frequent and I started a family, I stopped posting altogether. When I started applying for new jobs and trying to earn my career tenure with the federal government, I took the blog down from public view and I never put it back up. While I didn't think any of my high school lamentations would be career-ending, I didn't perceive a benefit to leaving them online either.

But I still loved my blog. It was authentically mine in a way that few things have ever been. So, I took some steps to preserve it. A few years ago I downloaded the entire blog from Blogger — in one big, messy file — and converted it to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). (In hindsight, I should have been writing in Markdown the whole time, but I didn't know about it when I was writing the blog.) I placed each blog entry in a separate Markdown file and used them to populate a locally-hosted static site generator. I also took time to track down every embedded photo that was still available — in the highest resolution I could find — and make them viewable within the locally-hosted site, while commenting out lost photos I'd unfortunately embedded from sources like Facebook. After all of this, I finally felt like I had the fast, simple, customizable blog that I'd always wanted but that I hadn't been technically-savvy enough to create when I was younger. It was a joy to peruse my old travels and experiences in such a format.

Ever since I completed this project, I've wondered whether I should start a new blog. I still don't have a lot to say that others would find interesting. But I'd still like to have a place to share stories and photos, at least once in awhile. And I want to have my own online home rather than using algorithm-driven social networks, which I strongly dislike.

I can't make the internet less scary. I can't turn back the clock on the unfortunate trends that have taken hold since I started blogging. But I can try to make things a little better by bringing back one element of the old web that I still love: my own website.
