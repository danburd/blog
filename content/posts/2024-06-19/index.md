There are 25 public elementary schools in Arlington, VA. 20 are neighborhood schools and 5 are "[option schools](https://www.apsva.us/schools-programs/#es-options)," for which parents can enter a lottery to enroll their child. There are two Spanish immersion schools, one Montessori school, one "[Expeditionary School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expeditionary_learning_schools)", and one "[Traditional School](https://ats.apsva.us/)."

I've often viewed these option schools with dismay; not necessarily because of the education they provide, but because of the impact they have on other schools. These impacts had been rarely discussed, but they have recently been subject to scrutiny following [a proposal to spend approximately $40 million](https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/arlington/Board.nsf/files/D5XLTW5568A2/$file/G-2%20School%20Board%20Proposed%20FY2025-34%20CIP%20Supt%20Prop%20CIP%20Presentation%20(Rev.%20060524%201126%20am).pdf#page=67) to renovate a building for the Montessori school's usage. This will drain Arlington's already limited funds, which could alternatively be spent to fix its crumbling neighborhood schools.

I join those who are skeptical of this plan. More broadly, I want to explain why option schools have been bad for Arlington.

### Engagement Gap

My children attended preschool in our neighborhood, very close to our home and to our neighborhood school. When my oldest child was graduating preschool, I was excited for him to attend his neighborhood school with his classmates and neighbors. However, I was dismayed at how many enrolled in option schools instead. I sensed that we would no longer be as close with these families as we had been, which indeed turned out to be the case.

More importantly, these were parents who were active in the community and engaged enough with the school system to make an affirmative choice to attend an option school. Their energy and engagement would have been an asset at our neighborhood school — a much-needed asset, I would soon learn.

It didn't take long after that first school year to realize that our neighborhood school's PTA was underperforming. Their website hadn't been updated in ages, the meetings provided no useful information, and the PTA itself had had its tax exemption revoked by the IRS, among other compliance deficiencies. Myself, my wife, and others came together to get elected to the PTA board the following year and we remedied these deficiencies. But we rarely had the volunteers we needed, and even getting those volunteers wasn't easy. We got used to seeing the same few faces over and over again.

Option school communities rarely face this challenge to the degree that neighborhood schools do. Their PTA's are robust, their boards full, their events well staffed. This is in part because their parents are sufficiently engaged to make the decision to send their children to an option school — they also tend to be sufficiently engaged to volunteer there, as well.

One example of this phenomenon is the annual 5th grade overnight field trip to the [Outdoor Lab](https://outdoorlab.org/). There were new requirements this past school year for chaperones this year for schools intending to stay overnight; our school was one chaperone shy of the requirement, so the field trip was two day trips rather than an overnight. In contrast, the nearby option school (according to one account related to me) had an embarrassing parade of chaperone cars heading into the Outdoor Lab when it was their turn for the field trip. They were able to stay overnight. This trip is typically a memorable capstone of students' elementary school experience, though now it is a chief example of inequality in our school system.

### Bilingual Brain Drain

One quarter of the families at our neighborhood school speak Spanish at home. Many of the parents do not speak English. One of our priorities in the PTA was to ensure these families felt included. We set about translating flyers into Spanish and conducting outreach on our school's Spanish WhatsApp group. I speak decent Spanish, but when I was issuing written communications on behalf of the PTA I would have liked a fluent bilingual speaker to review my work. Unfortunately, these fluent bilingual speakers were vanishingly rare at the neighborhood school. The reason is simple — they send their children to the Spanish immersion option school.

And why wouldn't they? They speak both languages and they want their children to do so as well. But the harm in our community was real. And it wasn't just that I didn't have someone to review my translations. There wasn't really anyone who could "bridge the gap" between the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking populations at our school. Almost all of the Spanish-speaking parents at our school were recent immigrants, typically from Central America. They were unfamiliar with American life, including how a PTA works. I'd also guess that many were undocumented. They were understandably reluctant to draw attention to themselves in any way, which inhibited them from volunteering at their child's school. One immigrant mother didn't want to fill out Arlington's volunteer form because it required a police background check — she was worried it would bring attention to her undocumented status. The school assured us that this was not the case, but I couldn't blame her for not taking the risk. Finally, these families tended to be low-income and worked many hours with an inflexible schedule. Even if they were willing to volunteer, many did not have the time.

By contrast, many parents of students at our nearby Spanish immersion school are second-generation immigrants. They are far more familiar with American life, and are more affluent as well. (This is borne out by their PTA's budget, which is twice as large as ours.) Their white collar jobs enable them to volunteer more frequently. They would be a huge asset at our school, especially as mentors to our immigrant families. But, they aren't there.

### Racial Segregation

[Our school](/2023-05-20), and our school system, was racially segregated by statute. There are still vast differences in the racial makeup of schools in our system, due in part to historical settlement patterns, wealth disparities, zoning rules, and concentration of subsidized housing. However, option schools also contribute to modern-day racial segregation. White families are opting out of majority-minority schools, and into option schools where there are more White people.

APS does not publish demographic information of families choosing option schools over neighborhood schools, but for at least one year this information can be inferred. In 2020, APS released [detailed demographic information](https://www.apsva.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PU-Data-Fields-List_ES-Phases-2-and-3-Update-10.02.2020.xlsx) about elementary students in each planning unit as of Fall 2019 as part of a boundary change process. These statistics can be summed up to determine the racial makeup of each school's attendance zone. They can then be compared to published data from 2019-2020 on the racial makeup of each neighborhood school to determine 1) how many students of each race in each attendance zone chose to attend option schools, and 2) what the impact of those transfers were on the demographics of the neighborhood schools.

I've performed this analysis and the results are below. As a result of option school transfers, 18 of the 19 then-existing neighborhood schools had their majority or plurality racial group's share of students either grow or not change; most grew. In short, the option school transfers do, generally, make neighborhood schools more segregated.

{{< figresize o=720x src="files/white-flight.png" caption="White families disproportionally opt-out of majority-minority schools, contributing to racial segregation." >}}

It's important to mention three schools in particular — Barcroft, Carlin Springs, and Drew — where the opt-outs and their results are particularly stark. In those three high-poverty, majority-minority attendance zones, more than half of White families felt that option schools were a better fit for their child. (It's possible that even more families tried to enroll their children into option schools but were unsuccessful.) The rate of nonwhite families opting out was measurably lower, a gap that is less obvious, nonexistent, or even reversed at more affluent schools. The result is that at Carlin Springs, the epicenter of this phenomenon, the share of White students is about half of what its attendance zone would anticipate, with an astounding 65% of its White students opting out. Its Hispanic majority increased accordingly from 62% to 67%. Similarly, due to opt-outs, Barcroft's 43% Hispanic plurality ballooned to a 51% majority.

It's instructive to examine one planning unit in particular — 35040. This corresponds generally to the Glencarlyn neighborhood. This predominantly White, low-poverty neighborhood is zoned for Carlin Springs, and is in its walk zone as well. However, the parents of 33 of 40 students in this neighborhood — 82% — chose option schools over their walkable neighborhood school. I am skeptical that they are all doing it for the pedagogy.

### Stability Gap

Option schools admit the students for whom they have room, and no more. When they have reached that point, they "pull the drawbridge up." If students leave, the school may admit additional students from their waitlist. They are shielded from the considerable mid-year churn of students in a place like Arlington, where people move in and out frequently.

Our school is not shielded. In fact, having an option school nearby has the opposite effect. All (or nearly all) mid-year enrollees in our very populous attendance zone attend our school, as the option schools have waitlists that pre-date these students' residence in Arlington. The result is that our school admitted over 80 students between the start and end of this school year, with a net gain of 50 students. The school is obligated to seat every student who resides in their attendance zone. There is no drawbridge to pull up. It doesn't matter when they enroll; one student started on the second-to-last day of school. Furthermore, the school administration said that 96% of these mid-year enrollees were English learners, many with interrupted formal education. This churn, and these types of students are a challenge for our school, in both education and in building a long-term community — a challenge that isn't shared equally among schools.

### The Limits of Outreach

Option school proponents often rebut these points by arguing that Arlington could do more to inform low-income families and immigrant families about option schools. The thinking goes that if only these families knew about option schools, they'd sign up in greater number and that the disparities I've described would cease to exist.

This is wishful thinking. For many families, an option school is simply not in their best interest. One reason is that parents want to be able to easily get to their child's school, whether for an emergency or for routine events and meetings. However, many low-income families and immigrant families do not have cars. Option schools are almost always going to be farther away than a neighborhood school. They may require a lengthy bus ride, or perhaps they aren't reachable at all on public transit. Who can blame them for not wanting to send their kids to a school they can't get to?

Also, immigrant families often want their children to attend school with their neighbors so they can have a support network. It's difficult enough being in a new country — sending your child to a different school than their neighbors likely seems like an unnecessary difficulty. Perhaps the parents work long or inflexible hours and they need their neighbors to pick up their kids from time to time. This is far easier if your child attends the same school and rides the same bus as other neighborhood children.

### The Mirage of Superior Pedagogy

Option schools occasionally tout their test scores to demonstrate the effectiveness of their teaching methods. To the degree that their test scores are higher than neighborhood schools (which isn't always the case), I believe this largely reflects the socioeconomic differences in the type of family who enrolls their child in option schools versus those who don't. Option school famiiles tend to be wealthier, are less likely to be first-generation immigrants, and are more likely to stay the whole school year. All of this provides a boost to test scores, and it has nothing to do with their teaching methods.

There is also a survivorship bias. Students for whom the option school pedagogies aren't effective simply leave to attend their neighborhood school instead. Therefore, the option schools are left with a student body for whom their chosen pedagogy is effective — a luxury that neighborhood schools don't have.

### A Power Imbalance

By virtue of their disportionately engaged parents, option schools have well-informed communities who are savvy about lobbying for themselves. In the brawl of Arlington budget battles, where the loudest voice often carries the day, they know how to make their desires heard. The Montessori proposal is an example of this. The community was well-represented in advisory groups like the [South Arlington Working Group](https://go.boarddocs.com/vsba/arlington/Board.nsf/files/9XDLCD4D67D6/$file/C-4%20SAEWG%20member%20appointments%20061015.pdf) and the [Arlington Career Center Expansion Building Level Planning Committee](https://www.apsva.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2023/05/ACC-BLPC-Appointments.pdf), both of which led to the $40 million plan that's now in contention.

The proposal would starve neighborhood schools of much-needed funds to perform basic maintenance on their aged buildings. This [CCPTA letter](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1C1RUElePKPN-Hwobkx7c7oclf7yqmdUnSn-lNaWLyns/edit) and [this letter from several prominent Arlingtonians](files/June2024_APS_CIP_Letter.pdf) explain it better than I ever could.

Moreover, I feel that an Eisenhower-esque warning is necessary here. We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence by option school communities. To that end, and to work toward an equitable education for all Arlington students, I would love for all option schools to be converted back to neighborhood schools.
